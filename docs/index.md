## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Monkeyninja5/LPG/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


Welcome to the Local Physicians Group Website, in the Local Physicians Group we strive to provide the best medical care to you and your family.

### Jekyll Themes
